# ECE592-DiscreteGaussianSamplingforFALCONDigitalSignature
 Abstract: The advent of quantum computing threatens the foundations of classical cryptography, necessitating quantum resistant alternatives. FALCON, a lattice-based digital signature scheme standardized by NIST, offers compact and secure solutions for post-quantum cryptography. A critical component of FALCON’s signature generation process is Discrete Gaussian Sampling (DGS), accounting for a significant portion of computational overhead. This report presents a hardware implementation of DGS designed to enhance FALCON’s performance, targeting the Xilinx Zynq SoC FPGA architecture. The proposed design employs a full hardware approach, partitioning base sampling and rejection sampling between programmable logic and processing systems. Experimental results demonstrate a speedup of approximately 29.5× in throughput compared to the software implementation. This scalable and efficient implementation showcases the potential of hardware acceleration in quantum-safe cryptographic operations for real-time and resource-constrained environments.
